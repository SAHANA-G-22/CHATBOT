# CHATBOT
This chatbot is an AI-based application built using FastAPI and integrated with Groqâ€™s LLaMA-3.1-8B model. It allows users to chat naturally, and the bot responds with human-like answers. The chatbot uses a conversation ID to manage separate sessions for each user. Messages are sent to the LLM through the Groq API, and replies are generated based on the input and chat history. The project also uses Pydantic for data validation and CORS middleware for cross-platform access. This chatbot demonstrates how large language models can be used in real-time applications to provide smart, interactive conversations.
